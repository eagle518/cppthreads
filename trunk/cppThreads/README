 * cppThreads ( POSIX Threading Wrapper for C++ )

== Prerequisities ==
 1- makesure you have autotools installed (GNU build toolchain)
 2- gtest 1.3+ installed (needed only to run the tests)
 3- libtool must be installed

== Build ==

There are several scripts written to make your life easier, simply start with ./autogen.sh that would generate a whole bunch of new files then simply issue ./buildme

the libraries are then built and moved to libs/

if you want to run the test cases, cd tests/ and use the script ./autogen.sh and make 

then use the ./runner to start all of the test cases
